# Pap-smear-cells-classification

This Work was done as part of TELECOM-PARIS's course IMA205: 'Apprentissage pour l'image et la reconnaissance d'objet'. I finished first in the challenge among 48 Telecom-Paris students). The assignment is about identifying the cells type.

I achieved an  MCC (Matthews correlation coefficient) score 0.832 by using transfer learning.

The Papanicolaou test, abbreviated as Pap test or Pap smear test, is a method of cervical screening used to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous processes. The World Health Organization - WHO - stated that there are at least 500.000 new case per year worldwide and that around 90% of them could be avoided if detected and treated at an early stage. The test is usually performed manually by taking a specimen - smear - from the uterine cervix. This is then transferred onto a thin glass plate  and stained using the Papanikolaou method which makes it possible to analyse the cells with a microscope. However, manual screening is a tedious and error prone task. This is why the implementation of an efficient computer-assisted methodology for automated classification Î¿f cell images is of uttermost importance.
